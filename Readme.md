# The Drone Hacker’s Handbook Repo

Welcome to the official companion repository for **The Drone Hacker’s Handbook: A Pentester’s Guide to Exploiting Unmanned Systems** (No Starch Press, 2026).

This repo is your field kit. Inside, you'll find the payloads, exploits, firmware, reverse-engineering artifacts, and tools referenced in the book—organized chapter by chapter. You’ll also find raw radio captures, GNURadio flowgraphs, APKs, companion scripts, and other offensive drone-hacking resources designed for real-world training or red teaming simulations.

Each chapter folder contains hands-on materials for the techniques taught in that section. Start there.

## Tools and Projects Featured
This repository hosts or links to the following drone exploitation tools:

- Damn Vulnerable Drone — dockerized drone hacking lab

- MAVSploit — MAVLink telemetry spoofing and injection framework

- SiKW00F — SiK radio discovery, eavesdropping, and fingerprinting tool

- GNURadio Flowgraphs — frequency scanning, FHSS tracking, and demodulation

- Drone Hacking Scripts — pymavlink PoCs, firmware backdoors, GPS spoofers, and more

## Disclaimer
This repository is for educational and authorized security testing purposes only. Do not use these techniques on any drone, network, or system you do not explicitly own or have written permission to test. Violating airspace or drone laws can result in serious penalties.

We’ll keep this updated as readers provide feedback.

## Book Overview
If you haven’t picked up the book yet, The Drone Hacker’s Handbook is a hands-on guide to:

- Mapping and attacking the full UAV ecosystem: flight controllers, radios, GCS, ROS2

- Setting up a complete drone hacking lab using Docker and SDR

- Exploiting MAVLink, SiK telemetry, Wi-Fi, GPS, APKs, and firmware

- Attacking real-world drones without needing physical hardware
